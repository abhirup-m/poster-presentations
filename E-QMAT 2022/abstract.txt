In this work, we obtain the minimal Hamiltonian for an effective impurity model that captures the Mott metal-insulator transition of DMFT on the Bethe lattice in infinite dimensions. The minimal model is found to have the Anderson model parameters, as well as a Kondo coupling $J$ and a local attractive correlation $U_b$ on the bath site that is coupled to the impurity (the zeroth site). Such a model shows a transition from a Kondo screened phase to a local moment phase at a critical value of $U_b/J$. The transition occurs through the generation of sub-dominant pairing fluctuations in the bath that destroy the Kondo cloud and lead to the isolation of the local moment, gapping out the impurity spectral function in the process. We argue that the spectral function of the zeroth site closely resembles that of the impurity spectral function, because of the coherent spin-flip fluctuations introduced by $J$, and that achieves the essence of the self-consistency condition of DMFT. By focusing on the model very close to the transition, the minimal theory for the transition is found to be described by a $J-U_b$ model - a Kondo model with an attractive correlation on the zeroth site. Adiabatic motion along various lines in the spectrum of this model explains the observation of a coexistence region from DMFT calculations, while the zero-bandwidth limit of such a model shows the level-crossing between the singlet state and the local moment states at the critical point. Certain correlation functions calculated from our approach are found to be in agreement with those calculated from NRG-DMFT.
